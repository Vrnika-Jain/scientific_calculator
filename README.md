# Scientific Calculator

## Introduction
The Scientific Calculator is a Java-based application designed to perform a wide range of mathematical calculations, from basic arithmetic to advanced scientific functions. This document provides an overview of its features, functionality, and usage instructions.

## Features
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Advanced Functions: Square Root, Exponentiation, Logarithm, Factorial
- Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent
- Memory Functions: Memory Recall (MR), Memory Addition (M+)
- Additional Utilities: HCF (Highest Common Factor), LCM (Least Common Multiple)

## Interface
The calculator's interface consists of:
- Text Field: Displays input and results.
- Buttons: Represent numeric digits, arithmetic operators, and scientific functions.

## Usage
1. Numeric Input: Click on the numeric buttons (0-9) to enter numbers.
2. Arithmetic Operations: Use the respective buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
3. Scientific Functions:
- Square Root: Calculates the square root of a number.
- Exponentiation (x^2, x^3): Computes squares and cubes of numbers.
- Logarithm (log): Calculates the natural logarithm of a number.
- Trigonometric Functions (SIN, COS, TAN): Computes sine, cosine, and tangent values.
- Factorial (n!): Computes the factorial of a number.
4. Memory Operations:
- Memory Recall (MR): Retrieves the value stored in memory.
- Memory Addition (M+): Adds the current result to the memory.
5. Additional Utilities:
- HCF (GCD): Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- LCM: Calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.
6. Error Handling: The calculator handles division by zero gracefully and displays appropriate error messages.

## Future Enhancements
- Scientific Constants: Include constants like Ï€ (pi) and e (Euler's number).
- Unit Conversions: Add support for unit conversions (length, area, volume).
- Graphical Plotting: Integrate graphical plotting of functions.
